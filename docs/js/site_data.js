When OpenAI Foundation released their ASR model Whisper, we got an effective tool for this task. This release was somehow in a shadow because of ChatGPT euphoria. This focus on AI development and, what is more important, it's effective usability in different areas put Whisper as one of the best tools for ASR. Its support for low resource languages was a huge improvement but results in a low quality of transcripts. The new challenge was to improve support for low resource languages and the response of the community was great, they published fine tuned models in various low resource languages with improved results in accuracy.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce Whisper ASR model, explain the process of fine tuning for Serbian and give possible use cases.

The number of installed cobots and the size of the market are increasing dramatically every year. To further increase the acceptance of collaborative robots and enable smooth physical interaction, we need to make them understand the environment and human behavior patterns and quantify the interaction parameters. In the conversation, current achievements in the field will be briefly presented, current projects implemented within the Laboratory for Robotics - ETF Robotics, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the University of Belgrade will be presented, and perspectives for further development in local and global frameworks will be discussed.</p>\n<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Kosta Jovanović is an associate professor and head of the \"ETF Robotics\" research group at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (ETF) of the University of Belgrade.

He graduated in 2009 from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering as the best student in the study program for electrical engineering and computer science. In 2016, he received his doctorate at ETF in the field of robotics under the mentorship of Prof. Veljko Potkonjak, and gained professional experience at the company \"SMS Siemag\" (2009), the Technical University of Munich (2010) and the Institute for Robotics and Mechatronics - German Center for Space Research (DLR, 2013), all in Germany. He was a scholar and coordinator of the Alumni Club of the program for students of the Dr. Zoran Đinđić Foundation and the Committee for Economic Relations of Germany with Eastern Europe, as well as a scholar of the Academic Exchange Service of the Republic of Germany (DAAD). His scientific contributions are reflected in the design and management of drives of new generations of robots, the development of methods for safe and efficient physical cooperation of robots with the environment, and methods of application of collaborative robots in industry and medicine. So far, he has published more than twenty papers in respected international journals, and only in the last 2 years the research in which he participated was presented in the most respected robotics journals: IEEE Robotics Automation Magazine, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, Journal of Robotics Research. His works have been cited more than 1,600 times.

      "description": "<p><strong>DATA SCIENCE CLUB</strong> (powered by <strong>МАШИНЕРИЈА</strong>) announces its third meetup in <strong>Novi Sad</strong>! This time we prepared two very interesting talks. Our speakers will be Mikhail Rozhkov and Roman Steinberg.</p>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 18, 16:00 - 19:00 CET<br />\n<strong>Where:</strong> Startit center, Novi Sad, Miroslava Antića 2</p>\n<p>First talk:<br />\n<strong>Build Data validation and Model Monitoring pipelines with DVC and Evidently</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />\nData validation and model monitoring are critical aspects of any machine learning project. Data validation involves verifying that the data used for training and testing a model is accurate, complete, and consistent with the intended use case. Model monitoring involves tracking the performance of a model over time to ensure that it continues to meet the desired performance criteria and does not drift from its original performance.<br />\nIn this talk we will explain the importance of data validation and model monitoring in machine learning projects and demonstrate how to use DVC and Evidently to implement robust data validation and model monitoring pipelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaker:</strong><br />\n<strong>Mikhail Rozhkov</strong><br />\n<strong>ML engineer and MLOps Solutions Architect</strong><br />\nMikhail Rozhkov is an ML engineer and MLOps Solutions Architect with over 7 years of experience in Machine Learning and Data Science. He is a founder of the ML REPA community (<a href=\"http://mlrepa.org/\">mlrepa.org</a>), and author of courses on ML automation, DVC, and MLOps topics.<br />\nHelped 200+ engineers learn advanced concepts and tools for ML engineering and MLOps. Collaborated with 50+ companies and ML teams in US, Europe, and Asia to design MLOps processes and integrated open-source tools.<br />\nLinkedIn:<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnrozhkov\"> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnrozhkov</a><br />\nGitHub:<a href=\"https://github.com/mnrozhkov\"> https://github.com/mnrozhkov</a></p>\n<p>Second talk:<br />\n<strong>Can't collect data - generate it</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />\nThis talk will focus on the lack of data problem and one of the ways to solve it - data synthesis. In the beginning, we will discuss some cases and interesting papers which use data synthesis. Finally, we consider an example of a real project in one of the banks, where it was necessary to train neural networks on synthetic data.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaker:</strong><br />\n<strong>Roman Steinberg PhD, CTO &amp; co-founder</strong> at Vision Systems with 25 years in IT Industry.

We will hold our traditional networking session immediately after Ivan's talk!</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>Machine learning algorithms, in combination with signal processing techniques, give outstanding results in many fields, especially when an abundance of data is available. However, working in niche fields often requires creativity and careful analysis in order to present adequate and interpretable results with often limited data. This happens very often in the fields of scientific research, where good quality and large datasets are hard to find.</p>\n<p>The talk will present the experiences and challenges that come with using machine learning, focusing on signal classification and regression using limited datasets. We will cover two very different fields of research that are surprisingly similar from the perspective of data science: the detection of dyslexia using eye-tracking data and the calibration of low-cost air quality devices.</p>\n<p><strong>About our speaker</strong></p>\n<p>Ivan Vajs is a junior research assistant at the Innovation Center of the School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade and a Ph.D. student at the School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade.
